# 🚀 Crypto Tracker

A React + Redux cryptocurrency tracker built with the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api). Browse coins ranked by market cap, search for a specific coin, and drill into a coin's page to see its price history on an interactive chart.

## 📦 Features

### 💰 Market Table

* Paginated table of all coins ranked by market cap (price, 24h change, market cap).
* Live search/filter by coin name or ticker.
* Responsive layout — market cap column and coin names collapse on small screens.
* Clicking a row navigates to that coin's detail page.

### 📊 Coin Detail Page

* Coin logo, name, description, market cap rank, current price, and market cap.
* Historical price line chart (Chart.js) with selectable timeframes: **24 Hours**, **30 Days**, **3 Months**, **1 Year**.

### 💱 Currency Switcher

* Toggle prices between **USD ($)**, **PKR (Rs)**, and **INR (₹)** from the header. All prices, charts, and market data update accordingly.
